,

,
"1964":"<b>The 1964 Summer Olympics</b> was held in Tokyo, Japan. Tokyo had been awarded the organization of the 1940 Summer Olympics, but this honor was subsequently passed to Helsinki because of Japan's invasion of China, before ultimately being canceled because of World War II. The 1964 Summer Games were the first Olympics held in Asia, and the first time South Africa was barred from taking part due to its apartheid system in sports. (South Africa was, however, allowed to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics, also held in Tokyo, where it made its Paralympic Games d√©but.) These games were also the first to be telecast internationally.

Fewer than half the participants of the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam returned to compete in 1932. US President Herbert Hoover did not attend the Games, becoming the second sitting head of government not to appear at an Olympics hosted in that country. This was Hoover's second time not attending an olympiad held in the US during his presidency, as the Olympic winter games were held in Lake Placid, New York, earlier the same year. The first US president who did not attend a games was President Theodore Roosevelt, at the 1904 III Olympiad held in St. Louis, MO. His absence was due to the fact that David R. Francis, Mayor of St. Louis, refused any help officiating the Games."

,
"1924":"<b>The 1924 Summer Olympics</b> was celebrated in Paris, France. The home city of Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern games, was selected over bids of Amsterdam, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, and Rome, though Paris had also hosted the 1900 Games."
,
"1920":"<b>The 1920 Summer Olympics</b> were held in Antwerp, Belgium. The 1920 Games were awarded to Antwerp to honor the people of that city after the suffering they endured during World War I. The initial choice for the site of the Games had been Budapest, Hungary. Though the majority of events took place in Belgium, there was a single sailing event which took place in Dutch waters and as such, the games were officially in both countries."

With the exception of tennis (starting on May 5), football and shooting (both starting on June 29), the games were held within a month.

It is the only full Olympics to be held in Sweden."
,
"1908":"<b>The 1908 Summer Olympics</b> was held in London, England, United Kingdom. These games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome. At the time they were the fifth modern Olympic Games.

The IOC president for these Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin."

"1906":"<b>The 1906 Intercalated Games</b> or 1906 Olympic Games were celebrated in Athens, Greece.

"1904":"<b>The 1904 Summer Olympics</b> were celebrated in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States from 1 July 1904, to November 23, 1904, at what is now known as Francis Field on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis."
,
"1900":"<b>The 1900 Summer Olympics</b> were celebrated in 1900 in Paris, France. No opening or closing ceremonies were held; competitions began on May 14 and ended on October 28. The Games were held as part of the 1900 World's Fair. One thousand competitors took part in 19 different sports. Women took part in the games for the first time and Charlotte Cooper became the first female Olympic champion. The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes, who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest."
,
"1896":"<b>The 1896 Summer Olympics</b>, officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, was celebrated in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era. Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organized by Pierre de Coubertin, a French pedagogue and historian, in Paris, on June 23, 1894. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was also instituted during this congress."

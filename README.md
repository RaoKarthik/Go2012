#### About

This app was designed and built in 2012 and available for free on iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. The code is released as reference material for you to have a dig around. The world of Javascript is moving so fast, if I did this again I would do things very differently e.g...

 - Use [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) to do the hard work
 - Use precompiled [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) instead of client compiled [Less](http://lesscss.org/) 
 - Use dynamic views like [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
 - Use smarter Class based Javascript separation

- [JQuery](http://jquery.com) (Vers 1.6.1)
